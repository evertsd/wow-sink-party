## WoW Party-Sync frontend
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Getting started
To get started, you'll need firebase credentials so the app can pull down party data.
- Get a `credentials.json` and put in `tome/src/secrets`
- Create a `.env` file with the credentials using a script in `tome`
```
cd ../tome
npm run build
npm run create-env
```
